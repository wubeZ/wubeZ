## 👨‍💻 About Me

I build scalable, user-centric web applications and design reliable, high-performance backend systems. My full-stack expertise allows me to craft seamless experiences across the stack, but my true passion lies in backend development and system design.

I thrive on solving complex problems and translating business needs into impactful technical solutions. I enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams to turn complex requirements into scalable, user-friendly products.

Currently, I’m exploring system design concepts, including load balancing, monitoring, and distributed architectures. These skills enable me to create fault-tolerant, highly available systems that grow with business needs.

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me reading about system design or experimenting with new tools and technologies to stay ahead of the curve. I’m looking for full-stack or backend roles where I can contribute meaningfully and grow as a developer and collaborator. 

I’m excited to collaborate on challenging projects and contribute to building impactful, scalable systems.
